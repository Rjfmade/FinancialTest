Hi there! welcome to the FinancialTest Repo! This is a test performed for assessing my skills made recently. 
The idea is to loop through a given dataset of financial instruments and their references in these files:
https://github.com/Rjfmade/FinancialTest/tree/main/INPUT%20DATA/DB
https://github.com/Rjfmade/FinancialTest/tree/main/INPUT%20DATA/REFERENTIAL

**PART 1**

In this first part of the exercise the objective is to retrieve a table with all the intruments in the reference list and the last updated information if any.
I put the emphasis in demonstrate that I could use complex structures and tools such as:
- Double Loops
- Managing Large Dictionaries of DataFrames
- Dynamically accessing to directories in the repo
- Nested ifs
- Different functions

The code is in this file:
https://github.com/Rjfmade/FinancialTest/blob/main/FirstPart.py

And the output could be retrieved from:
https://github.com/Rjfmade/FinancialTest/blob/main/OUTPUT%20DATA/PART1/output1.csv

**PART 2**

The objective of this part is to connect to an external API and extract all the missing information up to date automatically and as efficiently as posible based on the table created in the PART 1. Therefore, in this second part the focus was on being as efficient as possible by basically avoiding unnecessary looping as much as possible:
(Also some list comprehension) 

The code is available in this file:
https://github.com/Rjfmade/FinancialTest/blob/main/SecondPart.py

And the output could be retrieved from:
https://github.com/Rjfmade/FinancialTest/blob/main/OUTPUT%20DATA/PART2/output2.csv

Please enjoy,

Also let me recommend you a nice film: https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0166896/
